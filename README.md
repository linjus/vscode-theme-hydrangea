Hydrangea
=========

This is a Visual Studio Code theme inspired by hydrangea. Many colors were chosen from
actual bloom colors that range from pink through blue. For this reason, there are only
subtle differences among highlights.

I have been tested this theme with the following languages:
 - F#
 - Go
 - JSON
 - XML
 - YAML
